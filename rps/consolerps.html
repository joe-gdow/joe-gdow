    <!-- 
     I think it would be cool to have a pokemon style battle scene but in the visual style of street fighter.
     The player character and computer character have a team of 3 fighters: rock, paper, scissor.  When the user
     selects a fighter it comes to the forefront of the battlefield and fights the computer's fighter.  Health bars
     can represent the score and whenever a fighter loses a set number of rounds they are defeated.  
     It could also be made more difficult by eliminating fighters that are defeated.  The winner of the first round
     would gain a significant advantage but maybe this could be offset by doing more health damage depending on how many
     fighters you have left.
